            <li>"Teenagers who are 16 and 17 years of age are entitled to consent to their own treatment and follow the standard adult protocol, and this consent cannot be overruled by their parents. Children who are under 16 years old can consent to their own treatment if it is thought that they have enough intelligence, competence and understanding to fully appreciate what is involved in their treatment."<sup><a href=#ref1>[1]</a></sup></li>
            <li>"At present specialist gender identity development services for children and young people under 16 are not available in Scotland. Children and young people should contact their GP or a GIC in the first instance and thereafter may be referred to the Gender Identity Development Service at The Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, London."<sup><a href=#ref1>[1]</a></sup></li>
            <li>"There is a specific service for young people under the age of 19 years. This service is provided by a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist.A full assessment will be carried out and the patientâ€™s family will be invited to participate in discussions,
if the young person gives consent. Young people will also have the opportunity to discuss issues on an individual basis. In some circumstances, young people may be referred for a paediatric
8endocrinological opinion (if under 13 years).Occasionally, young people may be referred to their local child and adolescent mental health team for further assessment/interventions."<sup><a href=#ref2>[2]</a></sup></li>
