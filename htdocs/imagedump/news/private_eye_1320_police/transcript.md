**POLICE LOG**

**Neasden Police Station**

* 8.00hrs

All officers were redeployed from normal duties onto Operation Twitterwatch, monitoring suspicious and criminal tweeting activity over the Olympic period. 115 60-inch plasma-screen television sets were installed in the station, to enable officers to correlate tweets and Olympic-related events.

* 10.30hrs

First major tweet alert recorded while officers were watching heats of 20-kilometre kayak time trial at Hampton Court. PC Brondesbury picked up tweet from member of the public, Kev94 sending message concerning failure of GB's competitor Matt Coracle to qualify for quarter-finals because of collision with marker pole. Our "Tweet Detectives", headed by Sergeant Hainault, subjected the message to forensic examination and concluded that its wording "stick pole up your arse Matt you wanker and then drop dead" was a clear incitement to murder and an offence under the Terrorism and Allied Offences Act 2006.

* 11.45hrs

Armed "Tweet Swat Team" was ordered to track down and arrest the suspect Kev94. Following exhaustive investigation (i.e. asking Twitter to give us his address), the suspect was identified as Kevin Snott residing at Flat 412, the Tessa Jowell Estate, Poundstretcher Road. 317 officers surrounded the suspect's address and after breaking down the door of his bedsitter, managed to disarm him of his mobile phone, which was retained as evidence, and placed him under arrest. Suspect put up a brief resistance, necessitating use of taser and pepper spray, but no live rounds were required, in accordance with the new guidelines on Avoidance of Killing Civilians Unless Strictly Necessary.

* 13.15hrs

Suspect was detained in custody at Neasden Central and charged with five criminal offences relating to his tweet before being discharged.

* 13.30 - 21.00

Officers celebrated successful operation by continuing to monitor Olympic sporting events in alternative venu viz the Slug and Lettuce in Pricerite Avenue.

* 21.00

Duty Officer Sgt Kenningtom returned to the station to find emergency answerphone full of messages from members of public reporting incidents of burglary, theft, assault, domestic violence, and murder. Sgt deleted all low-priority requests for assistance, i.e. all of the messages and tweeted to followers: "Police cannot cope with huge increase in workload due to Twitter Crime".
